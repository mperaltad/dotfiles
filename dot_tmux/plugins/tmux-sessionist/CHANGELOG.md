### v2.2.0, 2015-01-29
- bugfix: when a pane containing "vim" is promoted to a session, the moved pane
  has dimensions 80x25. This is the default `new-session -d` win size. Fixing
  this by first switching to a new session (so the window is resized), then
  pulling target pane over.
- 'goto-session' feature - when session list does not fit on the screen, show it
  in columns
- 'goto-session' - when all the sessions don't fit on the screen, the last
  displayed element is '...' indicating there's more sessions

  'ruby_foo'.

  command for creating new sessions now explicitly uses appropriate socket file.
